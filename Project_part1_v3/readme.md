# 1. IMBA Entity Relationship Diagram(ERD) Design

This ERD example model a simple order system with the following entities:

* Aisles: stores aisles’s data.
* Departments: stores a list of products departments categories.
* Products: stores a list of products.
* Orders: stores sales orders placed by customers.
* OrdersProduct: stores order line items for each order.

## Order_products Table and Table

Order_products --> Products
* An order line could be included one or multiple products, so the relationship from Order_products table to Products table is **One to One**.

Products --> Order_products
* A product could be a part of **no orders**, but it also could be a product of many orders, so the relationship from products to order is **One to Zero/Many**.

## Products and Aisles Table

Products --> Aisles
* A product can only include one aisle, so the relationship from products to aisles is **One to One**.

Aisles --> Products
* An aisle could include one or multiple products, so the relationship from aisles to products is **One to One/Many**.

## Products and Departments Table 

Products --> Departments
* A product can only include one department, so the relationship from products to departments is **One to One**.

Departments --> Products
* A department could include one or multiple products, so the relationship from departments to products is **One to One/Many**.

## Order_products and Orders Table

Order_products --> Orders
* An order can have multiple products; each product will be shown in a separate line (called as OrderLine) in the Order_products table. So there can be one or more order lines for a single order, so the relationship from Order_products to Orders table is **One to One**.

Orders --> Order_products
* For each order, there will be one or more order lines in Order_products table. However, if an order gets cancelled (destroyed) or any other specific reason, then order lines could not exist in the Order Products table. So the relationship from Orders to Order_products is **One to Zero/Many**.

# 2. SQL Query from IMBA Data Set
Design a query to join orders table and order_products table together, filter on eval_set = ‘prior’
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM ORDERS
LEFT JOIN ORDER_PRODUCTS
    ON ORDERS.ORDER_ID = ORDER_PRODUCTS.ORDER_ID
WHERE eval_set = 'prior'
LIMIT 10;
```
